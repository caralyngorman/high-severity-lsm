# Landscape pattern of high severity fire via landscape metrics
### This repository contains data and code examples for understanding the pattern of high severity burn in western US landscapes.  

* The `example_code_data` folder contains raster files and a .csv which can be used with the code in `code_example.Rmd` to calculate landscape metrics relevant to resilience in western US ecosystems. A thematic representation of this code can be found in `code_example.pdf`.

* The `lsm_calculations_all_fires.csv` file contains all values for landscape metrics calculated and used to understand differences in spatial pattern among fires of different sizes in the western US.
